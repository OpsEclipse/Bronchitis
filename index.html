                            <p>To keep from getting bronchitis, try not to be in close contact with people who have cold
                                 or flu-like symptoms. Wash your hands regularly,
                                 and don’t touch your eyes, mouth, or nose. The flu can cause bronchitis.
                                  That’s why it’s smart to get your flu shot every year.  Quit smoking.[5] Studies show that people who smoke cigarettes or are exposed to a
                                   lot of secondhand smoke are much more likely to develop chronic bronchitis.[6] Because of this, it is important that you quit smoking
                                    and avoid second-hand smoke if you are concerned about getting bronchitis. Substances in the cigarettes may
                                   cause your respiratory tract to become inflamed which then makes you more prone to getting a bacterial or viral infection.</p>
